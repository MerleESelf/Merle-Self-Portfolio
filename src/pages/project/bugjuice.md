In choosing this project, I wanted to continue to grow my understanding of development within the framework of Next.js. I also wanted expose myself to newer technologies and libraries used for modern web development such as Formik and Yup for form creation, and validation, respectively; utilizing Supabase for my hosted database, and leveraging SupabaseAuth to set up third party user authentication via GitHub; I also sought to create a simplistic yet appealing UI/UX utilizing Daisy UI components; Tailwindcss class based styling was also leveraged to create a responsive design, enabling the user to use the app both on desktop, and in their browser on mobile.

Working on this application allowed me to continue to hone my skills in all areas of the development life cycle. From initial ideation, planning and design of features, setting up the repo, establishing the front end, enabling user auth, directing and storing data on the backend, and finally deployment. I continued to leverage the skills I learned through Grace Hopper, and open myself up to new challenges. One such challenge I successfully tackled was enabling drag and drop across sections of the workflow. Overall I'm happy to say that the app in this current iteration is complete.

I hope to continue scaling Bug Juice to include views for multiple task lists, housed under different projects. I would love to enable push notifications and alerts for tasks that have an upcoming due date. Experimenting with GitHub integration, enabling users to leverage Bug Juice as a project board is something that I'm also highly interested in tackling. I would love to see where scaling this application takes me.
