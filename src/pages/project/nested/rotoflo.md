RotoFlo utilized a wide variety of technologies to help actualize our vision. The most prevalent of these being TensorFlow.js, ReactWebcam and html5Canvas.

TensorFlow: TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.

The canvas element is part of HTML5 and allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. It is a low level, procedural model that updates a bitmap. HTML5 Canvas also helps in making 2D games.

React Webcam is a library that provides a React compatible webcam componet. Alongside MediaRecorderAPI, React Wecam allows you to instantiate and record an active stream.
