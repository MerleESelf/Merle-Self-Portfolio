				<h2>Professional Background</h2>
				<p>
					Hey there! I’m Merle, a Junior Fullstack Software Engineer, and I'm
					currently looking for my first job as a Dev! Prior to my time in tech
					I’d been working in Staff Management within the broader world of
					customer service, and speciality coffee. During that time I managed
					staffs small as 8, and large as 100 employees. I loved being able to
					help staff members develop professionally and personally. However,
					over the last three years, I’ve done a lot of introspection to
					identify my interests for the future of my career and seeing how I can
					apply those to my desire to participate in sustainable, and impactful
					work. I’ve always been fascinated with the key role that technology
					has played in the world of information equity, and its ability to
					change the landscape of many different industries. I'm extremely happy
					that reconsidering my path lead me to code. I've always been a very
					curious person, and seek out new subjects to immerse myself in. In
					August of 2021 I decided to leave my previous postion, and spend the
					next few months prepping myself on JS fundementals. I then applied to
					the Grace Hopper program through Full Stack Academy. After being
					accepted, I spent January through April 2022 learning modern JS web
					development, focusing on React, Node, Redux, and PostgreSQL. It's been
					both a challenge and a joy to learn Javascript development, to say the
					least. Since graduating in April, I've been focusing on personal
					projects, and exposing myself to new frameworks and languages such as
					Ruby on Rails, Typescript, and Next. I'm looking forward to all the
					new opportunities that are to come!
				</p>
				<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
				<p>
					JavaScript | Typescript | React | Next | Redux/RTK | Node | Express |
					Ruby on Rails | SQL | PostgreSQL | Sequelize | GIT | GitHub | JWT/Auth
					| HTML5 | CSS3 | Figma | Formik
				</p>
				<h2>Personal Background</h2>
				<p>
					In my personal life I really love to create, and engage with my
					various hobbies. I'm and avid plant collector, caring for upwards of
					70 plants. Hoyas are by far my favorite genus, making up the vast
					majority of my collection. Learning about plant care and other aspects
					of Botany is something that I'm very passionate about. I'm also a self
					tought fiber artist; learning crochet at 14, later focusing on
					knitting, embroidery, macrame, collage, decopage, latte art, and
					drawing. In my free time you can find me exploring local beaches for
					shells to add to my collection, hiking, and spending time at home in
					Brooklyn with my cat, Homefries, and dog, Pepper.
