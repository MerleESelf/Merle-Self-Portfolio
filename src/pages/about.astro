					Hey there! I’m Merle, a Junior Fullstack Software Engineer. I'm
					currently looking for my first role as a Tech professional. Prior to
					my time in tech I’d been working in Staff Management within the
					broader world of customer service, and speciality coffee. Over the
					last two years I’ve done a lot of introspection, identifying my
					interests for the future of my career, and seeing how I can apply
					these to my desire to participate in sustainable, and impactful work.
					I’ve always been fascinated with the key role that technology has been
					playing in the world of information equity, and its ability to change
					the landscape of many different industries. I'm looking forward to all
					the new opportunities that are to come!
				</p>
				<p>
					In my personal life I really love to create and engage with my various
					hobbies. I'm and avid plant collector, caring for upwards of 70
					plants. Learning about plant care and other aspects of Botany is
					something that I'm very passionate about. I'm also a self tought fiber
					artist, learning croceht at 14, later focusing on knitting,
					embroidery, macrame, collage, decopage, and drawing.
